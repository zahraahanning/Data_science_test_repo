## R Markdown

This an R Markdown file where I show examples of what I can do on an R Markdown file so far.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r test}
test <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
summary(test)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(c(1,2,3,4,5), c(1,2,3,4,5), col='red',main="Zahraa's graph",col.main="black",xlab="test x-axis",ylab="test y-axis")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
